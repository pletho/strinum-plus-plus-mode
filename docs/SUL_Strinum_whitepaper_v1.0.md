Abstract

Large Language Model (LLM)–based development environments increasingly suffer from semantic drift, session inconsistency, and integration instability.
This paper introduces a structural paradigm combining SUL (Structured Union Language) and Strinum++MODE, a layered domain modeling and orchestration framework designed to restore deterministic consistency in multi-session AI-assisted development.

Rather than introducing a new programming language, this framework proposes a semantic-layer architecture and organizational execution model above implementation logic.

1. Introduction

LLMs are powerful but fundamentally probabilistic systems.
When used across multiple sessions and modular workflows, common issues arise:

Context fragmentation

Role ambiguity

Cross-session semantic drift

Non-deterministic integration behavior

Traditional solutions attempt to solve these through prompt engineering or memory persistence.
However, these approaches remain execution-centric rather than structure-centric.

This paper argues that the root problem is absence of structural domain stratification.

2. Problem Statement
2.1 The Collapse of Unstructured AI Workflows

In multi-agent or multi-session environments:

Session A redefines domain assumptions.

Session B modifies flow logic without semantic constraints.

Session C integrates conflicting outputs.

Because there is no semantic authority layer, integration becomes unstable.

2.2 Structural Deficiency

The core failure is not LLM intelligence.
It is the absence of:

Immutable domain intent layer

Cross-layer contamination rules

Agent boundary enforcement

3. SUL (Structured Union Language)
3.1 Definition

SUL is a domain structuring philosophy that introduces layered semantic control across development flows.

It is not a programming language.
It is a structural model above execution.

3.2 Layered Model

SUL defines four stratified layers:

L0 – Domain Intent Core

Immutable domain authority.
Defines purpose and semantic invariants.

L1 – Flow Structure Layer

Primary operational logic aligned with domain intent.

L2 – Interaction Control Layer

Behavioral modules and modular interaction logic.

L3 – Event Micro Layer

Fine-grained execution actions and event units.

3.3 Contamination Rule

Upper layers cannot mutate lower-layer authority.

Lower layers cannot redefine domain intent.

Cross-layer mutation requires formal trigger validation.

This ensures structural determinism.

4. Strinum++MODE
4.1 Definition

Strinum++MODE is an organizational orchestration model for AI-driven development.

Where SUL defines semantic structure,
Strinum++MODE defines execution governance.

4.2 Core Components

Core Contract Authority (CCA)

Modular Session Isolation

Orchestrator Persona Control

Integration Trigger Mechanism

4.3 Execution Flow

Core freeze

Module split

Parallel session execution

Validation checkpoint

Controlled integration

This replaces ad-hoc prompt chains with structured AI collaboration.

5. Combined Paradigm

SUL + Strinum++MODE together form:

Layer	Function
SUL	Semantic domain structuring
Strinum++MODE	Organizational execution control

This creates a deterministic orchestration model for probabilistic AI systems.

6. Comparative Analysis
Traditional LLM Usage	SUL + Strinum++MODE
Prompt-driven	Structure-driven
Memory dependent	Contract dependent
Session fragile	Layer isolated
Integration reactive	Integration validated
7. Applications

This framework is particularly applicable in:

AI-assisted software architecture

Digital twin simulation systems

Multi-agent development pipelines

Complex domain modeling (logistics, automation, AI orchestration)

8. Limitations

Requires disciplined structural thinking

Not suited for ad-hoc single-shot scripting

Organizational overhead exists in early adoption

9. Conclusion

LLM systems are probabilistic engines.
Deterministic outcomes require structural governance.

SUL introduces semantic stratification.
Strinum++MODE introduces execution orchestration.

Together, they form a structural paradigm for scalable AI-driven development.

10. Future Work
